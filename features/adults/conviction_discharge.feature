Feature: Conviction
  Scenario Outline: Discharge
  When I am completing a basic 18 or over "Discharge" conviction
  Then I should see "What discharge were you given?"

  When I choose "<subtype>"
  Then I should see "<known_date_header>"

  And I enter a valid date
  Then I should see "<length_type_header>"

  And  I choose "Years"
  Then I should see "<length_header>"
  And I fill in "Number of years" with "10"

  Then I click the "Continue" button
  And I check my "conviction" answers and go to the results page

  Examples:
    | subtype                | known_date_header                   | length_type_header                                                | length_header                         |
    | Conditional discharge  | When were you given the discharge?  | Was the length of the conditions given in weeks, months or years? | What was the length of the discharge? |
